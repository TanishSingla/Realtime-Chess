# Real-Time-Chess

This is a real-time chess application that allows two players to play a game of chess over the web. The first player to join gets the white pieces, and the second player gets the black pieces. The game board will reset automatically if one player leaves, and you can refresh the page to start a new game after the current game ends. If a third player joins, they will be a spectator and cannot move the pieces but can watch the game.
